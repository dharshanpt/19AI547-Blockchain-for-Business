# Ex No: 3 - Supply Chain Transparency for Luxury Goods

## Date : 24-04-2025
# Aim:
To develop a smart contract that tracks the supply chain of luxury goods, ensuring authenticity.
# Algorithm:
## step 1:
Manufacturer inputs productId and name, and registers the product if it's not already registered.
## step 2:
Contract stores the product with name, msg.sender as currentOwner, and sets verified = true.
## step 3:
For ownership transfer, contract checks if msg.sender is the current owner of the product.
## step 4:
If valid, contract updates currentOwner to the new owner's address and emits an event.
## step 5:
Repeat the ownership transfer at each supply chain checkpoint by authorized parties.
## step 6:
Buyer or verifier inputs productId to retrieve product details from the smart contract.
## step 7:
Contract returns the product’s name, currentOwner, and verified status for authenticity check.
## step 8:
All actions (registration and transfers) are permanently recorded on-chain for transparency and trust.

    function registerProduct(uint256 productId, string memory name) public {
        require(products[productId].currentOwner == address(0), "Product already registered");
        products[productId] = Product(name, msg.sender, true);
        emit ProductRegistered(productId, name);
    }

    function transferOwnership(uint256 productId, address newOwner) public {
        require(products[productId].currentOwner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
        products[productId].currentOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(productId, newOwner);
    }

    function verifyProduct(uint256 productId) public view returns (string memory, address, bool) {
        Product memory p = products[productId];
        return (p.name, p.currentOwner, p.verified);
    }
}
```
# Expected Output:
A luxury good (e.g., a Rolex watch) is registered on-chain.


Ownership is transferred at every checkpoint.


Buyers can check the authenticity before purchasing.


# High-Level Overview:
Helps prevent counterfeit luxury goods.


Teaches real-world supply chain use cases.
