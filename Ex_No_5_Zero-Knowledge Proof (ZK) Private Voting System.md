# Experiment 5: Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZK) Private Voting System
# Aim:
To implement a fully private and transparent voting system using Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs). This ensures that votes are counted fairly without revealing who voted for whom.

# Algorithm:

Step 1: Each voter creates a secret and makes a hidden (hashed) commitment of their vote.

Step 2: Voters register by submitting their hidden commitment to the smart contract.

Step 3: During the voting period, voters wait without revealing their actual vote.

Step 4: After voting ends, voters reveal their secret and choice to the contract.

Step 5: The contract checks if the revealed vote matches the original commitment and counts it.

Step 6: Finally, the total votes are announced without revealing who voted for whom.

```
# Expected Output:
Voters commit their votes privately.


When revealed, the contract verifies correctness but keeps votes anonymous.


Final result is publicly verifiable without exposing individual votes.



# High-Level Overview:
Uses ZKPs to ensure anonymous and fair elections.


Prevents vote tampering while maintaining voter privacy.


Mimics real-world ZK voting applications in governance and DAOs.
